 Overview
The objective is to recognize human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, etc., from grayscale images of human faces. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset, which is widely used for facial expression recognition tasks.
 Features
Deep Learning-Based Emotion Detection: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to classify human emotions based on facial expressions.

Trained on FER-2013 Dataset: Leverages a large and widely used dataset containing 48x48 pixel grayscale images labeled with seven emotion categories.

Robust Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to improve generalization and training efficiency.

Emotion Classification: Detects and classifies emotions such as Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.

Training Monitoring: Provides real-time plots of training and validation accuracy/loss to track model performance across epochs.

Model Evaluation: Includes testing on unseen data and displays predictions along with true labels for qualitative assessment.

Modular and Extensible Code: Well-structured notebook allows easy adaptation for real-time detection or dataset customization.

Visual Output: Displays sample predictions with image previews and detected emotion labels for user interpretability.
